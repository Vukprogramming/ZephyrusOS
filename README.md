# Zephyrus OS
Zephyrus OS is a x86 operating system that im working on
this project stated 9/8/2025 and is still unfinished

![Current progress](Screenshots/currentProgress.png)

Currently it has:
* Basic VGA Text functions (print, newline, carrige return, scroll up and printHex)
* The GDT (Global descriptor table)
* The IDT (Interrupt descriptor table)
* Basic exception handling
* Debugging tools
And thats all (for now)

I will be adding a PIT timer later
(and maybe a basic PS/2 Keyboard driver)
