# Zephyrus OS
Zephyurs OS is my new project that i will be working on mainly (i will still be working on VK Shell on the side)
It is an x86 Operating system
And it boots using GNU Grub

![Current progress](Screenshots/currentProgress.png)

Currently it has:
* Basic VGA Text functions (print, newline, carrige return, scroll up and printHex)
* A GDT (Global descriptor table)
And thats all (for now)

I will be setting up the IDT later"# ZephyrusOS"
